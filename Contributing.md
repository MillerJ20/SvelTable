Where do I start?

If you have spotted a bug or have a feature request, please open an [issue post](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/SvelTable/issues/new). That way we can get further information from other users that have experienced the bug or confirm that the feature isn't already in development.
All other questions should be posted to the project's [reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltable/) Github is for bugs and feature requests only.

# Make a Pull Request

  `git pull upstream main`

Push the feature then create a pull request on GitHub.

We will review the pull request and make sure it passes all tests. If another pull request is merged before yours, you may be asked to rebase(update) your feature.
